2.0 (2019-12-20)
   The list of officially supported and tested ython/Django versions changed,
   and we'd like to do proper semver from now on, which is why there is this
   big jump.

   changes in the code itself.

   - Support Django versions still under maintenance.

   - Support Django 1.8 (various contributors).
   - Drop support for Django 1.6.
   - Windows fixes.

0.11 (2015-08-21)
    - Match webassets 0.11.

0.10 (2014-07-03)
    - Improve staticfiles/testing integration.
    - Support Python 3.
    - Face race condition during assets.py collection.

0.8 (2012-11-23)
    Based on 0.7-state from webassets core repository.

    - Staticfiles integration now allows for globbing.
    - Better document staticfiles support.
